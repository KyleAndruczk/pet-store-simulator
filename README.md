# Pet Store Simulator

Pet Store Simulator is a CLI game entirely built in Ruby. This game simulates the experience of an employee at a pet store. The user can choose a store at which they want to work, change the working hours and job status, choose to work at another store, and quit the job. The user can also view all the pets that they have, adopt a new pet, and remove all of the dead pets.

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository to a local directory. 
2. Run 'bundle install' in your terminal install/update all gems.
3. (Technically optional, but can help prevent an error where the code crashes after one inputs their years of experience in their job application) Run 'rake db:migrate' and 'rake db:seed' in your terminal to ensure that all pets, employees, and stores are readable/function properly.
4. Start a new game by running 'ruby ./bin/run.rb' in your terminal (from the root of the cloned repo). 
5. Have fun!!!
